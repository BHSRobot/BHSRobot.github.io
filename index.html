      <h3>Welcome to the Team!</h3>
      <p>We are a First Robotics Competition team from Bloomfield, New Jersey! our rookie year was 2015 and since then we have been progressively making better robots. The team is the largest it has ever been for the 2023 season with plenty of new members!</p>
      <p>There are so many people with interests that have allowed the team to start doing new and exciting things from much better video production to a lot more community outreach.</p>

		<h3>3/12/23 - Mt. Olive</h3>
		<p>The FMA Mt Olive event has ended and some issues with the bot have been discovered, but they will all be fixed. It showed us that we really need to practice more before our next event.</p>
		<h3>2/25/23 - New Website</h3>
		<p>We are happy to launch our new website here! We have had a website for many years but it was hosted on Google Sites so the URL was super long and it was not maintained. This new website will allow us to do some cool things and will let us customize it as much as we want.</p>
		<h3>1/23/23 - Initial CAD of 2023 Bot Finished</h3>
		<p>After many delays from the many ideas and proof of concepts built, the final CAD has been made! Now we will see how long it will take to turn the CAD into reality.</p>
