			<h3>H.M.R.D.W.N. (Charged Up 2022)</h3>
			<p>The construction of this robot was no easy feat for the team. It consists of multiple parts: a lower intake mechanism tha the team calls a cowcatcher and an upper elevator with a wrist and knockoff everybot intake. The idea of the cowcatcher is that it can be put put around a game piece so it can be dragged to a ground node. The whole upper system is designed to get game pieces off the shelves and to place them on the middle and top nodes. All of this is on a drive train that has 3 Neo motors on either side along with high grip placation wheels to get as much power and grip as possible.</p>
